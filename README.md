# uni-project-repos
This repository is a portfolio of some programming projects completed during my time at Michigan State University and University of Michigan-Dearborn. All projects are programmed in C++.

Program descriptions and key principles:

1. Othello
  - Constructed the game of Othello 
  - Object oriented design
  - Use of vectors, arrays, iterators. 
  - Modular design
  - Game engine
  
 2. GrayScale - (Manipulate PGM files)
  - Image convolution
  - i/o parsing in data, stringstreams
  - Image manipulation/transformations (convolve)
  - Polymorphism 
  - Object oriented design
  - File manipulation, i/o
  
 3. MultiValueMap
  - Custom data structure
  - Object oriented design
  - Polymorphism
  - Pointers & iterators.
  - Operator overloading
  
  4. RecordsSystem
  - Class heiarchy/inheritence
  - Subtype polymorphism
  - Custom Exception handling
  - Abstract functions
  - Pure virtual implementation
  
  5. Patterns
  - i/o parsing in data, string cleaning, stringstreams
  - Statistics
  - Pattern recognition
  - Documenting similarity of input files
  
 6. Solitaire
 - Linked lists
 - Stacks/Queues
 - Polymorphism

7. CIS-Land
 - Implements a custom data structure to take an undirected graph as input and sort into an adjacency list.
 - Structure needs to support dijkstra and prim implementations, along with amend capabilities based on user input.
